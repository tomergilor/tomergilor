"""
zipimport provides support for importing Python modules from Zip archives.

This module exports three objects:
- zipimporter: a class; its constructor takes a path to a Zip archive.
- ZipImportError: exception raised by zipimporter objects. It's a
  subclass of ImportError, so it can be caught as ImportError, too.
- _zip_directory_cache: a dict, mapping archive paths to zip directory
  info dicts, as used in zipimporter._files.

It is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is
used by the builtin import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths
to Zip archives.
